# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe

A robust, fully interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with vanilla JavaScript. This project focuses on clean state management, game logic optimization, and accessibility.

## 🚀 Features
- **Smart Game Logic:** Bug-free win and draw detection algorithms.
- **Dynamic State Management:** Tracks player turns (`X` vs `O`) and game status without page reloads.
- **Responsive Design:** playable on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Accessibility (A11y):** Keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly using semantic HTML buttons.
- **Modern UI:** Glassmorphism effects and CSS variable-based theming.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Custom Properties (Variables).
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Arrow functions, DOM manipulation, Event Listeners.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Implemented **separation of concerns** by keeping game logic distinct from UI updates.
- Mastered **DOM manipulation** to handle user interactions dynamically.
- Solved edge cases where a "Draw" condition would conflict with a "Win" on the final move.
